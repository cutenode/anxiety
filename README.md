anxiety is a part of my life and I've discovered it's a part of many other developers lives. Hopefully publishing a collaborative module of our collective anxieties can help normalize it for a fellow developer somewhere ðŸ’–

### but you're polluting the namespace

ok, if you have a legitimately better use for the name please feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to hand it over to you as long as you publish starting at the next semver major after the modules current semver major. At the time of publishing there are nearly 1m published modules and `anxiety` has not yet been taken so this argument feels invalid Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ 

if you care about the namespace perhaps check out the [JavaScript Standard Library proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-javascript-standard-library) from TC39 that introduces a namespace to JavaScript. If adopted, Node.js could also follow suit and implement a namespace, as could registries. Support it if you _actually_ care about this ðŸ’–
